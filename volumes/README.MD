# Docker Volumes

## Short description

Community [badcode](https://badcode.ru) gives such an analog of the definition:

Docker Volumes is a mechanism with which we have a container that stores persistent data (somewhere on the computer). This method is relevant because after the container is finished, the data is not saved. Thus, we can attach data (volume) to any of the running containers.

Instead of writing which folders we want to mount each time the container is launched, we can create one container with shared data, which we will then attach.

(Will be supplemented).
